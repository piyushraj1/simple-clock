# simple-clock
A simple clock project with the help of C++. In this project I have used the basic concepts of Data types, variables, manipulators, control statements and conditional statements. Also used functions like System("cls") to clear the screen. sleep() function which is declared in &lt;windows.h> header file. The use of sleep() is actually to suspend the execution of program temporarily for a period of time in milliseconds.
